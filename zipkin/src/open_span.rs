/// Spans can either be "attached" to or "detached" from their tracer. An attached span manages the
/// thread's current span - it acts like a `CurrentGuard`. A detached span does not but is `Send`
/// unlike an attached span. Spans are attached by default, but can be detached or reattached via
/// the `detach` and `attach` methods.
///
/// Detached spans are intended for use when you need to manually maintain the current trace
/// context. For example, when working with nonblocking futures a single OS thread is managing many
/// separate tasks. The `bind` method binds a span to a future, setting the thread's current span
/// each time the thread is polled. If some computation starts executing on one thread and finishes
/// executing on another, you can detach the span, send it to the other thread, and then reattach
/// it to properly model that behavior.
